## 📂 Repository Structure
# 📦 Data Engineering and Visualization Project

This project involves the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of job data, followed by analysis and visualization to gain insights into the Egyptian tech job market.

## Components

### `ssis_packges/Mongodb_to_sql_server`
- Contains SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) packages designed for performing ETL operations.
- These packages handle the extraction of data from a MongoDB source and load it into a SQL Server database.

### `wuzzuf_API_webscraping`
- A collection of Python scripts.
- These scripts are used to gather job data by interacting with the Wuzzuf API and performing web scraping on the Wuzzuf website.

### `Egyptian Tech Jobs.pbix`
- The Power BI dashboard file.
- This file contains the interactive visualizations, reports, and insights derived from the analyzed job data.

### `Jobs_Hr.bak`
- A SQL Server backup file.
- This file contains the schema and data for the `Jobs_Hr` database after the ETL process.

### `hr-data.csv`
- A cleaned dataset in CSV format.
- This file represents the refined data used for the analytics and visualizations within the Power BI dashboard.
